A quick and easy way to view a list of all the post types & taxonomies currently registered on your WordPress Install.

== Description ==

> This Plugin won Second Place in the 2016 WordCamp Orange County Plugin-a-Palooza

You install a plugin and it registers a portfolio custom post type. You would assume that the post type is "portfolio". After hours of digging, you discover that it's actually "porftolio_awesome_type". Wouldn't it be easier to have a list of all your post types, custom or default? We have you covered. Simply install and view the settings page. Thats where you'll find all the active post types on your current WP Install.

Why stop there? We have taken this one step further and included all taxonomies registered to a post type.

Supports all post types that come default with WordPress and all Custom Post types. Works with WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads, Custom Post Type UI, Pods & many more to come.

= FAQ =

We have excluded a few post types / taxonomies from Easy Digital Downloads & WooCommerce. Mostly because there is not a proper way to link them in the plugin options page.
