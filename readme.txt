== Description ==

Query All The Post Types is a Free WordPress Post Type Scanner Plugin. A great plugin for new WordPress Developers building themes/plugins/custom queries.

Every post type has a specific name. In that unique name lies a problem. Some post types are called "calendar" and some are called "my_other_calendar". These unique names can become a problem when building custom templates, shortcodes, or queries for your WordPress install. Query All The Post Types is a free WordPress plugin helping WordPress website owners, and developers, view of all the active post types, custom post types & associated taxonomies currently registered on your WordPress install.

Each post type is defined as a Regular CPT, Hidden CPT, WordPress Core - Regular CPT, WordPress Core - Hidden CPT, Regular CPT, Hidden CPT, WooCommerce Core Regular CPT, WooCommerce Core Hidden CPT, and Other. Query All The Post Types displays some object data for each post type. Object data includes: post type name, plural name, singular name, menu name, is public queryable, is hierarchical.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What version(s) of WordPress have been tested? =

As of now, we've tested the plugin on WordPress Version 4.1 and higher.

= Does this plugin work with all plugins & themes? =

Yes. However, it's impossible to know every post type active on your WordPress website. The post types we do know about, in popular themes and plugins, will be listed as Regular CPT, Hidden CPT, WordPress Core - Regular CPT, WordPress Core - Hidden CPT, Regular CPT, Hidden CPT, WooCommerce Core Regular CPT, WooCommerce Core Hidden CPT, and Other.

A definition is provided in the sidebar of the plugin settings page.

= What are post type definitions? =

We have set up a check to determine if a post type is public facing, hidden or some type of other custom post type. This is to make it easier for the end user to understand why a custom post type might be hidden from the WordPress Navigation Menu.
